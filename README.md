# Friday Night Funkin' - Tank Engine
idk if it is ever going to be perfered by anyone, but if you like it, honestly idk what to say it literally is just a better version of psych engine by like 1%, intended to be a fix for the psych version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it.

## Installation:
You must have [Haxe version 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/), seriously, stop using older or newer versions, it won't work!

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Psych Engine!*

If the compiler gives an error saying that hxCodec cannot be found read this issue to fix it: ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine#12770
